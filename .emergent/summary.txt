The AI engineer successfully progressed the Asset Inventory Management System through several complex feature developments and critical bug fixes. The work involved an iterative process, often requiring detailed debugging and re-evaluation when initial fixes didn't fully resolve user-reported issues. Key challenges included persistent frontend authentication and environment variable loading problems, which were eventually addressed by temporarily hardcoding the backend URL and frequent service restarts. The engineer effectively utilized sub-agents for backend and frontend testing, and crucial troubleshooting. Significant features delivered include a refined Asset Allocation page with dynamic data display and redesigned forms, comprehensive pagination/sorting/filtering across listing pages, and a major overhaul of the application's entry point with a new landing page, multi-step registration, and PayPal payment integration. The email notification system was also thoroughly debugged and fixed.
