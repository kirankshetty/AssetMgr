# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎯 DASHBOARD FUNCTIONALITY COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Extensive testing of Dashboard functionality across all user roles completed successfully. ✅ DASHBOARD CARDS ARE DISPLAYING CORRECTLY: Initial concern about missing dashboard cards was due to incorrect test selectors - all dashboard cards are rendering and displaying properly. ✅ ALL ROLE-BASED DASHBOARDS WORKING: Administrator Dashboard (4 cards: Total Asset Types: 5, Total Assets: 2, Available Assets: 2, Pending Requisitions: 0), HR Manager Dashboard (4 cards: Total Assets, Available Assets, Allocated Assets, Pending Requisitions), Employee Dashboard (3 cards: My Requisitions: 18, My Allocated Assets: 0, Available Assets: 2), Asset Manager Dashboard (8+ cards with comprehensive metrics including Damaged Assets, Lost Assets, Under Repair, Pending Retrievals, plus Allocation Rate: 0%, Availability Rate: 100%, Recovery Rate: 0%, and Asset Type Breakdown section). ✅ AUTHENTICATION & API INTEGRATION: All login flows working correctly with 200 responses. Dashboard API calls successful (/api/dashboard/stats and /api/dashboard/asset-manager-stats). Multi-role system integration perfect - role detection, role badges, welcome messages, and role-specific content all working. ✅ ROLE HIERARCHY & NAVIGATION: Role-based access controls working correctly. Navigation showing appropriate menu items for each role. Role selector working for multi-role users. ✅ NO CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND: Dashboard functionality is working perfectly across all user roles. The original concern about missing cards was a false alarm due to test selector issues."
