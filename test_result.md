# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Successfully navigated to NDC Requests page with proper title and description. Search and filter functionality present and working.

'Request for NDC' and 'Add Reason' buttons correctly hidden for Asset Manager (role-based access working). Asset Manager sees filtered view (0 requests currently assigned). ✅ ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL: Employee access correctly restricted - NDC Request menu hidden from Employee navigation.

Administrator access confirmed working. ✅ UI/UX VERIFICATION: Table formatting and responsive design working correctly. Status badges and icons properly implemented. Search functionality operational.

New requisition creation logic working correctly - manager_id field properly populated from user's reporting_manager_id.

    message: "🎯 ENHANCED ASSET ALLOCATION ROUTING TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY: Comprehensive testing of the Enhanced Asset Allocation Logic with location-based routing system has been completed with 100% success rate (21/21 tests passed). All three routing scenarios working perfectly: 1) Primary routing to Asset Manager with asset type + location match, 2) Secondary routing to Administrator fallback, 3) Edge case validation (rejection doesn't trigger routing). The system correctly sets 'Assigned for Allocation' status, populates routing fields (assigned_to, assigned_to_name, routing_reason, assigned_date), and maintains data integrity. AssetRequisition model was updated to include routing fields for proper API responses. The Enhanced Asset Allocation Logic is production-ready and fully functional. Only remaining task is 'Asset Type Manager Assignment - Frontend Form Integration' which needs frontend testing."
